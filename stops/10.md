This stop concludes your tour. 

In this audio tour, we have explored the death and burial practices of the ancient Egyptians, Greeks and Romans, and examined their beliefs about the afterlife. In doing so, we have learnt about the importance of remembering the dead and performing proper funerary practices in the ancient world.  We have also considered the different ways that Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans treated their dead, and what they believed happened to the soul after death. 

Thank you for joining us at the R.D. Milns Antiquities Museum.

Please wait at this final stop for further instructions from your tour guide about how to return your iPads and headphones.
