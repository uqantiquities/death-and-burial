The ancient Egyptians are well-known for mummifying their dead so that it could be recongised by the soul and receive nourishment. A person could not live and enjoy the afterlife without the ongoing preservation of their physical body.

By the Old Kingdom (around 2600 BC), the Egyptians had developed a method for preserving the body so that it remained lifelike and began placing their dead into coffins to protect the bodies from animals and other external forces. 

The first step in this process was to remove, mummify and place the internal organs and place the lungs, liver, intestines and stomach into Canopic jars. The brain was discarded, but the heart was preserved and placed back in the body. The body was then stuffed and covered with natron (a kind of salt) to absorb the moisture. Finally, the body was wrapped head to toe in layers of linen bandages with amulets positioned around the body for protection. The outer layers of the mummy were protected by richly decorated coffins covered in spells and images. 

Examples of these kinds of bandages, amulets, and coffins can be seen in this cabinet. Notice the many forms of amulets depicting different deities, and the painted coffin fragments, one in the form of a hand, from a wooden outer coffin.  

Although amulets are decorative in nature, the Egyptians believed that they also had protective powers. When placed inside the wrappings of a mummy, their role was to assist the deceased in the afterlife. Amulets depicting gods and goddesses invoked the powers of the deity, anatomical amulets were designed to protect body parts, and zoomorphic amulets invoked the attributes represented by particular animals.
